## Description of the Project

The idea is that you would play the ukelele to enemies (seeds) in order to help them grow into trees.

## Instructions for Use

WASD to move, mouse to aim, left mouse to fire.

## How It Works

The music and "laser" from the ukelele are both triggered by a series of "if" statements.

## Classes/Assets/References

Good chunk of the scripts came from YouTube/Reddit/Godot forum tutorials. Images came from Google Images. Ukelele song is "Carefree" by Kevin Macleod.

## What I Am Most Proud of in the Assignment

I got it out.

## What I Learned

I think I now have a better grasp on if and else statements.
